        "abstract": "The ubiquitousness of satellite imagery and powerful, computationally efficient Deep Learning frameworks have found profound use in the field of remote sensing. Augmented with easy access to abundant image data made available by different satellites such as LANDSAT and European Space Agency's Copernicus missions, deep learning has opened various avenues of research in monitoring the world's oceans, land, rivers, etc. One significant problem in this direction is the accurate identification and subsequent segmentation of surface-water in images in the microwave spectrum. Typically, standard image processing tools are used to segment the images which are time-inefficient. However, in recent years, deep learning methods for semantic segmentation is the preferred choice given its high accuracy and ease of use. This paper proposes the use of deep-learning approaches such as U-Net to perform an efficient segmentation of river and land. Experimental results show that our approach achieves vastly superior performance on SAR images with pixel accuracy of 0.98 and F1 score of 0.99.",

        "abstract": "The traditional sea surface temperature (SST) inversion model has a complicated parameter fitting process and poor adaptability in different sea areas. This paper presents an infrared remote sensing inversion model of SST based on deep neural network to refine the situation. The training data are the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) infrared remote sensing data on sunny days and measured data from buoy in Bohai. The accuracy of inversion results is analyzed, the determination coefficient of inversion and measured values is 0.98, the standard error is 0.71\u202f\u00b0C and the mean absolute deviation is 0.85\u202f\u00b0C, the results show good accuracy of the model.

        "abstract": "Water temperature is a fundamental property of river habitats and aquatic ecosystems. In some cases, assessing water temperature changes is restrained by the availability of historical observation. This study proposed a framework to address the water temperature data scarcity in thermal regime assessment by incorporating the long short-term memory (LSTM) network and the time series technologies. The factors affecting water temperature included air temperature, evaporation, and streamflow. Driven by the historical observation of these factors, the LSTM network produced long-term water temperature series. The time series technologies unraveled the temporal dynamics of the reconstructed water temperature. The trend, periodicity, and complexity were investigated using linear regression, trend-free pre-whitening Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope, wavelet transform, and moving sample entropy. The framework was applied in the Dongting Lake Basin, China, which drains four tributaries: Xiangjiang, Zishui, Yuanjiang, and Lishui Rivers. The LSTM network reconstructed the monthly water temperature series from 1960 to 2020, which was good surrogate data for thermal regime evaluation. The annual water temperature of the four tributaries increased significantly, with an average warming rate of 0.15 \u2103 per decade. Heterogeneity of tendency and changing rates existed across sub-basins and months, and the warming water temperature dominated the variation. A significant oscillation of a one-year period across six decades was identified in the Dongting Lake Basin. The water temperature complexity decreased significantly in the Xiangjiang, Zishui, and Yuanjiang Rivers, while it increased significantly in the Lishui River. The case study indicated that the framework was practicable and flexible with explicit structure. It could be applied in other basins to address water temperature data scarcity and support the comprehensive riverine thermal regime assessment.",

        "abstract": "The carrying capacity of water resources is key to the sustainable development of arid and semi-arid regions. There are important challenges related to the detection of discontinuous and crooked water bodies in the vast Mongolian Plateau, despite the availability of remote sensing technology which has the advantage of facilitating water observations over large areas and timelines. Given the high cost and low coverage of high-resolution images and the low resolution of images with high coverage, this study proposes a pixel-based convolutional neural network (CNN) method for the application of water extracted from the region of interest (ROI) to medium-resolution Landsat images. The pixel-based CNN method combines the texture and spectral features of the ground object by connecting the center pixels of the images to the surrounding pixels. ROI is used instead of full-label datasets, reduce the difficulty of building labels in low-to-medium-resolution images. Taking the Tuul River in Mongolia as a case, the pixel-based CNN method, the normalized difference water index threshold (NDWI) method, the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) threshold method, U-net model in deep learning, and the pixel-based deep neural network (DNN) method were used with medium-resolution Landsat 8 images with ROI labels. The pixel-based CNN method shows better water extraction results for the cloud, cloud shadows, and building areas, compared with other methods. The method proposed in this study had the highest verification accuracy (92.07%). It also has the advantages of fewer training parameters and shorter training time. The training accuracies of the pixel-based CNN, pixel-based DNN, and U-net were 99.90%, 96.98%, and 93.70%, respectively. All training models and calling methods were uploaded to GitHub (https://github.com/CaryLee17/Pixel-based-CNN).",

        "abstract": "Accurate water temperature forecasting is essential for understanding thermal regimes of rivers in the context of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances, such as dam construction. Machine-learning models proffer an empirically based approach to predicting water temperatures with a high degree of accuracy. This study explores the potential of long short-term neural network (LSTM), a type of deep learning method, to forecast daily river water temperatures and quantify temporal variations in thermal regime induced by changes in climate and by dam construction. The performance of LSTM is compared with that of several other models using daily water-temperature data for nine river gauges around the world. In a detailed analysis, the models are evaluated for the Yichang gauge on the Yangtze River to reconstruct the natural thermal conditions and help to assess daily water temperature variations induced by operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The collective results show that LSTM outperforms other methods for predicting mean daily water temperature in rivers, capturing accurately mean daily variations in thermal regime. The construction of the TGR strongly influenced water temperature variations at Yichang, producing the strongest cooling effect from mid-April to mid-May and the greatest warming effect in late December and early January. These marked effects are most prominent at the highest water levels in the TGR. The enhanced predictive capabilities of the LSTM model provide a powerful tool for water temperature forecasting and ecological management of rivers in the Anthropocene.",

        "abstract": "River width is an essential parameter for studying the river\u2019s hydrological process and has been widely used to estimate the river discharge. The existing approaches to measuring river width are based on remotely sensed imagery such as MODIS, Landsat to identify the river, and then estimate the river width. In this work, an alternate approach for river width estimation is proposed using the under-explored modality Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. SAR, unlike the traditional electro-optical sensors, can penetrate the clouds and can be used to collect the data in all weather conditions and even during the night. In this work, the river identification process is manifested as a binary semantic segmentation task in SAR images. For this, two state of the art deep learning algorithms (U-Net, DeepLabV3+) are utilized for river identification and subsequent width measurement. The proposed approach (DeepRivWidth) is used to estimate the width of the river of the Mangalore\u2013Udupi region of Coastal Karnataka (India). These rivers originate or pass through Western Ghats (UNESCO world heritage site), and the proposed river width measurement approach could provide critical input for ecologists besides assisting efficient water management of the region. The estimated width is compared with the manually measured width, and significant improvement in the accuracy was obtained compared to existing river width measurement approaches. Besides, the performance evaluation of semantic segmentation approaches for river identification on a publicly available dataset provides valuable insights into segmenting rivers in SAR images.",

        "abstract": "The Laurentian Great Lakes, one of the world&rsquo;s largest surface freshwater systems, pose a modeling challenge in seasonal forecast and climate projection. While physics-based hydrodynamic modeling is a fundamental approach, improving the forecast accuracy remains critical. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has quickly emerged in geoscience applications, but its application to the Great Lakes hydrodynamic prediction is still in its early stages. This work is the first one to explore a deep learning approach to predicting spatiotemporal distributions of the lake surface temperature (LST) in the Great Lakes. Our study shows that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, trained with the limited data from hypothetical monitoring networks, can provide consistent and robust performance. The LSTM prediction captured the LST spatiotemporal variabilities across the five Great Lakes well, suggesting an effective and efficient way for monitoring network design in assisting the ML-based forecast. Furthermore, we employed an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique named SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover how the features impact the LSTM prediction. Our XAI analysis shows air temperature is the most influential feature for predicting LST in the trained LSTM. The relatively large bias in the LSTM prediction during the spring and fall was associated with substantial heterogeneity of air temperature during the two seasons. In contrast, the physics-based hydrodynamic model performed better in spring and fall yet exhibited relatively large biases during the summer stratification period. Finally, we developed a statistical integration of the hydrodynamic modeling and deep learning results based on the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE). The integration further enhanced prediction accuracy, suggesting its potential for next-generation Great Lakes forecast systems.",

        "abstract": "As one of the critical indicators of the lake ecosystem, the lake surface water temperature is an important indicator for measuring lake ecological environment. However, there is a complex nonlinear relationship between lake surface water temperature and climate variables, making it difficult to accurately predict. Fortunately, satellite remote sensing provides a wealth of data to support further improvements in prediction accuracy. In this paper, we construct a new deep learning model for mining the nonlinear dynamics from climate variables to obtain more accurate prediction of lake surface water temperature. The proposed model consists of the variable correlation information module and the temporal correlation information module. The variable correlation information module based on the Self-Attention mechanism extracts key variable features that affect lake surface water temperature. Then, the features are input into the temporal correlation information module based on the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to learn the temporal variation patterns. The proposed model, called Attention-GRU, is then applied to lake surface water temperature prediction in Qinghai Lake, the largest inland lake located in the Tibetan Plateau region in China. Compared with the seven baseline models, the Attention-GRU model achieved the most accurate prediction results; notably, it significantly outperformed the Air2water model which is the classic model for lake surface water temperature prediction based on the volume-integrated heat balance equation. Finally, we analyzed the factors influencing the surface water temperature of Qinghai Lake. There are different degrees of direct and indirect effects of climatic variables, among which air temperature is the dominant factor.",

        "abstract": "Long-term climate change may strongly affect the aquatic environment in mid-latitude water resources. In particular, it can be demonstrated that temporal variations in surface water temperature in a reservoir have strong responses to air temperature. We adopted deep neural networks (DNNs) to understand the long-term relationships between air temperature and surface water temperature, because DNNs can easily deal with nonlinear data, including uncertainties, that are obtained in complicated climate and aquatic systems. In general, DNNs cannot appropriately predict unexperienced data (i.e., out-of-range training data), such as future water temperature. To improve this limitation, our idea is to introduce a transfer learning (TL) approach. The observed data were used to train a DNN-based model. Continuous data (i.e., air temperature) ranging over 150 years to pre-training to climate change, which were obtained from climate models and include a downscaling model, were used to predict past and future surface water temperatures in the reservoir. The results showed that the DNN-based model with the TL approach was able to approximately predict based on the difference between past and future air temperatures. The model suggested that the occurrences in the highest water temperature increased, and the occurrences in the lowest water temperature decreased in the future predictions.",

        "abstract": "Water temperature is an important indicator of water quality for surface water resources because it impacts solubility of dissolved gases in water, affects metabolic rates of aquatic inhabitants, such as fish and harmful algal blooms (HABs), and determines the fate of water resident biogeochemical nutrients. Furthermore, global warming is causing a widespread rise in temperature levels in water sources on a global scale, threatening clean drinking water supplies. Therefore, it is key to increase the frequency of spatio-monitoring for surface water temperature (SWT). However, there is a lack of comprehensive SWT monitoring datasets because current methods for monitoring SWT are costly, time consuming, and not standardized. The research objective of this study was to estimate SWT using data from the Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-3 (S3) satellites. To do this, we used machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), simple neural network (ANN), and deep learning techniques (Long Short Term Memory, LSTM, and Convolutional Long Short Term Memory, 1D ConvLSTM). Using deep and machine learning techniques to regress satellite data to estimate SWT presents a number of challenges, including prediction uncertainty, over- or under-estimation of measured values, and significant variation in the final estimated data. The performance of the L8 ConvLSTM model was superior to all other methods (R2 of 0.93 RMSE of 0.16 &deg;C, and bias of 0.01 &deg;C). The factors that had a significant effect on the model&rsquo;s accuracy performance were identified and quantified using a two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis. The results demonstrate that the main effects and interaction of the type of machine/deep learning (ML/DL) model and the type of satellite have statistically significant effects on the performances of the different models.
